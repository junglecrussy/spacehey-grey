# spaceheygrey
My first attempt at a basic Spacehey layout. Entirely greyscale visuals, a custom cursor, and the Courier Prime font used for the entire page. Made with CSS to be implemented into one of Spacehey's "About Me" sections.
This is my first original project made in CSS, so it' s lacking some helpful contextual details in the code, but it works perfectly. I will try to add these details in the near future.

For now, I will go over what each section of code controls.
